This repository contains datasets related to climate and agriculture, with data for both India and the USA. The datasets provide valuable insights into the impact of climate change on crop yields, water availability, and fertilizer consumption.

## India Data

### Description
The India data includes information on cotton cultivation in different states and districts. It comprises various features such as cotton area, production, yield, and precipitation for each month, along with minimum and maximum temperatures. The dataset also contains data on water deficit, actual water availability, potential water availability, and fertilizer consumption.

### File Details
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with 4705 samples and 103 columns.
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset with 2476 samples and 103 columns.

## USA Cotton Data

### Description
The USA data provides insights into cotton cultivation across states. It includes information on planted and harvested areas, crop yield, and various climate parameters like average temperature, precipitation, cooling degree days, and heating degree days. The dataset also includes indices related to drought severity and soil moisture.

### File Details
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with 560 samples and 25 columns.
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset with 400 samples and 25 columns.
